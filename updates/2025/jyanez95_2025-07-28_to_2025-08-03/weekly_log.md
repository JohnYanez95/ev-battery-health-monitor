## üìä Progress Tracking

### üèîÔ∏è Epic/Theme
> **Epic Name:** EV Battery Health Monitor - Phase 1.5 COMMON_DRIVER Verification
> 
> **Epic Goal:** Verify and validate the COMMON_DRIVER baseline profile to ensure it accurately represents typical EV driver behavior patterns from research
> 
> **Why This Matters:** Portfolio project needs a solid, research-calibrated foundation before expanding to specialized driver profiles for automotive industry credibility

### Week's Contribution to Epic
> Major breakthrough: Integrated comprehensive EV driver behavior research and created V2 user profile system with realistic SoC management (25-85%), charging frequency (3-7x/week), and safety overrides

| Create user_profiles_v2.py | Jul 30 | Jul 30 | üî® (Medium) | üî® (Medium) | COMMON_DRIVER baseline created |
| Update documentation (README + CLAUDE.md) | Jul 30 | Jul 30 | ‚ö° (Quick) | ‚ö° (Quick) | Phase 1.5 progress documented |
| Setup Jupyter notebook environment | Jul 30 | Jul 30 | ‚ö° (Quick) | ‚ö° (Quick) | notebooks/workspace.ipynb |

**Effort Scale:**
- ‚ö° Quick: < 2 hours
- üî® Medium: 2-8 hours  
- üèóÔ∏è Major: > 8 hours

### üéØ Stretch Goals
> *If time permits, I'd also like to:*

- [ ] **Goal 1:** Implement TRAVELING profile for road trip behavior *(Why: Research shows different charging patterns for long-distance travel - more DC fast charging, route planning)*
- [ ] **Goal 2:** Add COLD_CLIMATE profile for winter driving patterns *(Why: Cold weather significantly impacts charging frequency and SoC management - 30% range reduction)*
- [ ] **Goal 3:** Create URBAN vs RURAL profiles for infrastructure differences *(Why: Urban drivers rely more on public charging, rural drivers depend heavily on home charging)*

## üìù Daily Journal

### Monday - Jul 28
- **What I did:** Deep dive into EV driver behavior research - analyzed charging patterns, SoC management, and frequency data from American EV drivers study
- **Blockers:** None - productive research session
- **Tomorrow's focus:** Continue research analysis, focus on regional differences and seasonal variations

### Tuesday - Jul 29
- **What I did:** Completed EV driver behavior research analysis - documented charging frequency (3-7x/week), SoC comfort zones (25-85%), and identified calibration targets for simulator

## üéØ Weekly Output

### Completed
- [x] Research integration - "Charging Behavior of American EV Drivers" analysis
- [x] V2 user profiles system with COMMON_DRIVER baseline
- [x] Realistic SoC management (25-85% range)
- [x] Calibrated charging frequency (3-7 times/week)
- [x] Safety overrides (prevent <15% SoC)
- [x] Documentation updates (README.md + CLAUDE.md)
- [x] **Thermal safety system implementation** with multi-level protection (50¬∞C warning, 55¬∞C critical, 60¬∞C shutdown)
- [x] **Standardized testing framework** with backend/plotting/ module for organized test comparison
- [x] **Comprehensive thermal validation** with normal vs extreme condition tests

### In Progress  
- [ ] COMMON_DRIVER validation in notebook (0% complete)
- [ ] Additional profiles (COMMUTER, WEEKEND_WARRIOR) (0% complete)

### Deferred
- [ ] Full integration with existing simulator (Reason: Need to validate V2 profiles first)

## üí° Lessons Learned
- **Code Organization**: Separating plotting logic into reusable modules dramatically improves test standardization and comparison capability
- **Thermal Management**: Multi-level safety systems (warning ‚Üí critical ‚Üí shutdown) provide robust protection while maintaining system usability
- **Test Framework Design**: Identical test structure (same phases, duration, data collection) enables true apples-to-apples comparison between scenarios
- **Industry Standards**: Battery thermal limits (50-60¬∞C) are critical for safety - implementing proper power limiting prevents thermal runaway

## üîÑ Next Week Preview
- Complete COMMON_DRIVER validation in Jupyter notebook with comprehensive behavior analysis
- Create additional user profiles (COMMUTER, WEEKEND_WARRIOR) based on research patterns
- Consider Phase 2 preparation: FastAPI backend architecture planning
