# EV Battery Health Monitor

A web application for monitoring and labeling electric vehicle battery health events in time series data. Users can visualize battery performance metrics, interactively label anomalous events, and export labeled datasets for machine learning model training.

## 🎯 Overview

This project provides an interactive platform for EV battery data analysis, featuring:
- Real-time battery telemetry visualization
- Interactive time series labeling for anomaly detection
- Export capabilities for ML model training
- Simulated EV battery data generation

## 🔋 Features

- **Interactive Time Series Plots** - Zoom, pan, and explore battery metrics
- **Event Labeling** - Click-and-drag to label thermal events, charging anomalies, etc.
- **Data Simulation** - Generate realistic EV battery performance data
- **Export System** - Output labeled datasets in CSV/JSON format
- **Multi-metric Support** - SoC, voltage, current, temperature, and derived metrics

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React/Next.js with TypeScript
- **Visualization**: Plotly.js for interactive charts
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Deployment**: Docker + Docker Compose

> **📋 Industry Research**: This tech stack was chosen based on comprehensive analysis of current EV battery monitoring industry standards and best practices.
