## üìä Progress Tracking

### üèîÔ∏è Epic/Theme
> **Epic Name:** EV Battery Health Monitor - Phase 1.5 COMMON_DRIVER Verification
> 
> **Epic Goal:** Verify and validate the COMMON_DRIVER baseline profile to ensure it accurately represents typical EV driver behavior patterns from research
> 
> **Why This Matters:** Portfolio project needs a solid, research-calibrated foundation before expanding to specialized driver profiles for automotive industry credibility

### Week's Contribution to Epic
> Major breakthrough: Integrated comprehensive EV driver behavior research and created V2 user profile system with realistic SoC management (25-85%), charging frequency (3-7x/week), and safety overrides

### Task Effort Tracking

|------|---------|-----------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Research Integration - EV Driver Behavior | Jul 30 | Jul 30 | üî® (Medium) | ‚ö° (Quick) | Comprehensive analysis complete |
| Create user_profiles_v2.py | Jul 30 | Jul 30 | üî® (Medium) | üî® (Medium) | COMMON_DRIVER baseline created |
| Update documentation (README + CLAUDE.md) | Jul 30 | Jul 30 | ‚ö° (Quick) | ‚ö° (Quick) | Phase 1.5 progress documented |
| Setup Jupyter notebook environment | Jul 30 | Jul 30 | ‚ö° (Quick) | ‚ö° (Quick) | notebooks/workspace.ipynb |

**Effort Scale:**
- ‚ö° Quick: < 2 hours
- üî® Medium: 2-8 hours  
- üèóÔ∏è Major: > 8 hours

### üéØ Stretch Goals
> *If time permits, I'd also like to:*

- [ ] **Goal 1:** Implement TRAVELING profile for road trip behavior *(Why: Research shows different charging patterns for long-distance travel - more DC fast charging, route planning)*
- [ ] **Goal 2:** Add COLD_CLIMATE profile for winter driving patterns *(Why: Cold weather significantly impacts charging frequency and SoC management - 30% range reduction)*
- [ ] **Goal 3:** Create URBAN vs RURAL profiles for infrastructure differences *(Why: Urban drivers rely more on public charging, rural drivers depend heavily on home charging)*

## üìù Daily Journal

### Monday - Jul 28
- **What I did:** Deep dive into EV driver behavior research - analyzed charging patterns, SoC management, and frequency data from American EV drivers study
- **Blockers:** None - productive research session
- **Tomorrow's focus:** Continue research analysis, focus on regional differences and seasonal variations

### Tuesday - Jul 29
- **What I did:** Completed EV driver behavior research analysis - documented charging frequency (3-7x/week), SoC comfort zones (25-85%), and identified calibration targets for simulator
- **Blockers:** None - research integration going well
- **Tomorrow's focus:** Build user_profiles_v2.py with research-validated behavior patterns

### Wednesday - Jul 30
- **What I did:** 
  - Analyzed "Charging Behavior of American EV Drivers" research document
  - Created user_profiles_v2.py with COMMON_DRIVER baseline (25-85% SoC, 4.5 charges/week)
  - Updated README.md and CLAUDE.md with Phase 1.5 progress
  - Set up interactive Jupyter notebook for testing
- **Blockers:** None - productive research integration session
- **Tomorrow's focus:** Validate COMMON_DRIVER profile and add thermal safety limits

## üéØ Weekly Output

### Completed
- [x] Research integration - "Charging Behavior of American EV Drivers" analysis
- [x] V2 user profiles system with COMMON_DRIVER baseline
- [x] Realistic SoC management (25-85% range)
- [x] Calibrated charging frequency (3-7 times/week)
- [x] Safety overrides (prevent <15% SoC)
- [x] Documentation updates (README.md + CLAUDE.md)

### In Progress
- [ ] Thermal safety limits implementation (0% complete)
- [ ] COMMON_DRIVER validation in notebook (0% complete)
- [ ] Additional profiles (COMMUTER, WEEKEND_WARRIOR) (0% complete)

### Deferred
- [ ] Full integration with existing simulator (Reason: Need to validate V2 profiles first)
